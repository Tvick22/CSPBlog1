    "The procedure BinarySearch(numList, target) correctly implements a binary search algorithm on the list of numbers numList. The procedure returns an index here target occurs in numList, or -1 if target does not occur in numList.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following conditions must be met in order for the procedure to work as intended? Explain why.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "a) The length of numList must be even\n",
    "b) The list numList must not contain any duplicate values\n",
    "c) The values in numList must be in sorted order\n",
    "d) The value of target must not be equal to -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Option C must be met because binary search only works on a list that is sorted in order. The algorithm relies on comparing the target value to the middle element and deciding whether to search the left or right half. If the list is not sorted, the search will not work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popcorn Hack 2\n",
    "Which of the following statements correctly describes a disadvantage of binary search compared to linear search? Explain why your answer is correct and why the others are wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "a) Binary search takes more time on average than linear search\n",
    "b) Binary search cannot be used on unsorted lists without modifications\n",
    "c) Binary search always returns the first occurrence of the target\n",
    "d) Binary search can only be used on lists with unique values\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Option B is correct because the list has to be sorted in order to function while a linear seach doesn't need sorting. Option A is wrong because a binary search tends to be faster than linear. Option C is wrong because the search starts in the middle of the array. Option D is wrong because it would not matter if the array has non-unique values in a binary search.\n"
