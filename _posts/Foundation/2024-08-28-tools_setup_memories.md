## Shell Commands

> Remove

```shell
rm "directory-name"
```

- The remove command we used for the "mini quiz" is a very useful for deleting files and directories

> Make directory

```shell
mkdir "directory-name"
```

- The make directory comand will create new directories while you are in the command line. We used this to create our `./nighthawk` directory

> List

```shell
ls
```

- This will list all of the directories within your current directory.

> Change directory

```shell
cd "directory-name"
```

- This will change your current directory
