### Popcorn Hack 1

| Benifit of Technology on society |
| --- |
| Allows large buisnesses to connect with large groups of people. |
| Can help people in the heathcare industry. |

| Harmful Effect of Technology on society |
| --- |
| Can lead to cyberbulling and/or the spread of misinformation. |
| People can steal or gain access to your information. |

### Popcorn Hack 2

| Meaning of Negative Effects of Technology |
| --- |
| Negative effects of technology are the harmful impacts it can have, like health problems, social isolation, and reduced privacy. For example, it leads to cyberbulling, data leaks, and exploitation of personal information. Also greater technology could lead to job displacement and a change in the job market. Not exactly removing jobs but making different ones and removing the now redunant ones. |

| How can we use responsible programming to avoid harmful effects of programming? |
| --- |
| eliminating bias, protecting privacy, writing secure code will all help avoid the harmful effects by protecting your personal data. |

### Popcorn Hack 3

| Why is it important to understand the unintended consequences of technology, especially dopamine-driven technology? |
| --- |
| Understanding unintended consequences of dopamine-driven technology (like Instagram Reels or Tiktok) is crucial because it helps prevent addiction, mental health issues (like anxiety and depression), and social harm. |

### Homework Hack 1: Rethinking AI for New Uses
1. Choose an AI technology (e.g., Chatbots, Self-driving Cars, Facial Recognition).
2. Research & Explain how it was originally intended to be used.
3. Create a New Use Case – How could this AI be used differently than planned?
4. Analyze the Impact – List two benefits and two risks of this alternative use.

- AI Innovation: Facial Recognition
- Original Use: Designed for security and identification.
- New Use Case: Used in wildlife conservation to track endangered species.
- Benefits – Helps monitor animal populations, aids in preventing poaching.
- Risks – Potential misuse for unauthorized surveillance, costly to implement in remote areas.

### Homework Hack 2: : Ethical AI Coding Challenge

1. Identify a Problem – Choose an AI issue (e.g., job loss, bias in hiring, misinformation).
2. Describe the Risk – How does this AI create harm in society?
3. Propose Two Solutions – What programming techniques or policies could reduce this risk?
4. Write a Short Reflection (3-5 sentences) – Why is ethical AI development important?

- Problem: AI-generated deepfakes can spread misinformation.
- Risk: False videos and images can deceive people, damage reputations, and influence public opinion.
- Solution 1: Develop AI models that detect and flag deepfakes using pattern recognition.
- Solution 2: Implement strict policies requiring watermarks on AI-generated content.
- Reflection: Ethical AI development prevents harm and maintains trust in digital information. Ensuring transparency and accountability helps society distinguish real from fake content.

### Homework Hack 3: AI & Unintended Consequences Research Task
Many AI systems have unexpected effects on society. Your goal is to find and analyze a real-world AI example that led to unintended consequences.

- AI Example: Tesla’s Autopilot Crashes

- What Happened: Tesla’s AI-powered Autopilot was meant to assist drivers, but multiple crashes occurred due to the system misidentifying obstacles or failing to detect road conditions properly.

- Response: Tesla released software updates and issued safety warnings, emphasizing that drivers must remain attentive.

- Prevention: More rigorous real-world testing and enhanced object detection could have improved safety before mass deployment.
