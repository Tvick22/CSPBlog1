# Insights from the Student Panel
During the recent student panel, we discussed key strategies for success in computer science, I focused primarly on navigating interviews, college admissions, and internships.

#### 1. Master the Art of Self-Communication
The ability to clearly express who you are and what you bring to the table is essential. Whether in interviews, networking events, or casual conversations, effective self-communication can set you apart. Practice articulating your skills, experiences, and goals confidently.

#### 2. Plan Before You Code
Diving straight into coding might be tempting, but proper planning saves time and prevents frustration. Flowcharts, pseudocode, and diagrams are invaluable tools for mapping out your logic and problem-solving approach before you write a single line of code.

#### 3. Document Everything
Good documentation is more than a technical requirement—it’s a professional skill. Well-documented code makes you a valuable team member and demonstrates attention to detail. Consider it your way of telling the story behind your work, making it accessible to others and your future self.

#### 4. Get Hands-On with Tools Like Git
Internships often prioritize familiarity with tools that foster collaboration, such as Git. Whether you're contributing to open-source projects or working in a team, understanding version control is non-negotiable in today’s tech industry.

#### 5. Showcase Your Projects
When applying to colleges, your personal projects carry significant weight. Admissions committees want to see evidence of your creativity, initiative, and ability to turn ideas into functional products. Invest time in building projects that align with your interests and goals.

#### 6. Network Through Practical Contributions
Networking isn’t just about LinkedIn connections—it’s about demonstrating value. A practical way to network is by offering to create websites, apps, or tools for local businesses or organizations. These real-world experiences not only build your portfolio but also expand your professional circle.
