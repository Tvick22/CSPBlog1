## Homework

## Showcasing my work!

### **LinkedIn Post:**
> I made a post on LinkedIn highlighting the skills I gained and enhacned from doing this project. I made sure to formatt the post in a way that is simple and concise so people can easily see what I am trying to convey.

### **N@TM:**
> At this event, we presented our project as a group. This helped us practice facilitating a presentation in a large group. We gave each member a role in the presentation. For example, while Jackson talked about the frontend and project idea, I would inform the audience on the more technical backend features while showing the flowcharts and documentation. This would work by drawing in the audience with the fancy frontend design while also allowing us to go over the more technical/advanced features with an interested audience.
