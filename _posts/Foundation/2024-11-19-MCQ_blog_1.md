## **Question Types**:
  The MCQs include single-answer questions, where you choose one correct response, and a few "select two answers" questions. These assess your grasp of key computing concepts and your ability to apply them.

## **Topics Covered**:
  - Programming (concepts, algorithms, abstractions)
  - Data and information (data manipulation, visualizations, patterns)
  - The internet (security, protocols, data flow)
  - Global impacts of computing (ethics, societal change)

## **Key Concepts**
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Be comfortable reading pseudocode and predicting its behavior.
- **Abstractions**: Understand how abstractions simplify complex systems.
- **Data Representation**: Recognize binary numbers, data compression, and other data-related topics like bits.
- **Cybersecurity**: Be aware of encryption, security risks, and internet protocols.

## **Questions I got Wrong**

  - ![Question 1](https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/4c2e7b0b-f9f1-4754-8cdb-cfd8404f6888.jpg)

    This question was the first question I got regarding the assignment of variables, so I did not know how the AP Exam formatted this. I realized that the variable on the left of the arrow is assigned to the varible or data type of the right.

  - **Which of the following best describes one of the benefits of using an iterative and incremental process of program development?**

    Correct Answer: It helps programmers identify errors as components are added to a working program. This is because Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced.

  - ![Question 13](https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/bc3bdbd1-eb34-45f0-9217-468893a7364f.JPG)

    Correct Answer: The mobile app release led to users tending to write shorter messages. I need to make sure I clearly read each option and pay attention to key words.
