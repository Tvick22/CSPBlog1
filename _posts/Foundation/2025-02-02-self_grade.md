## Self Grade

| Assignment | Score | Reasoning|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 things you did over 12 weeks, Issues, burndown, presentation | 4.5/5 | I think over the past 12 weeks I've learned a lot regarding server deployment and encryption. From reverse proxys to password hashing, I think I've developed as a programmer and a learner of CSP. |
| Full Stack Project Demo, including CPT requirement highlights, and N@tM feedback | 2/2 | I've covered the CPT requirements in my feature (posts). I also thought that our team also did a great job at the N@TM event from what I heard. |
| Project Feature blog write up, using CPT/FRQ language | 0.9/1 | I covered the main idea of my feature (posts) and provided both a simple and technicle overview of the feature. I also provided a demo of the feature. |
| MCQ | 1/1 | I completed the MCQ and anlayzed my answers. I also listed some of the answers I got wrong and looked over them so I get them right next time. |

## Personal Reflection

#### Next Steps:
Now that I've completed this project, I plan to do more Computer Science related work in the future. I want to start applying for internships in the CS field, and I also plan to take CSA senior year. I think that knowing multiple people that are in the CS field will help me find internship opportunities and more opportunities in general.

#### Strengths:
Programming Skill/Debugging was a noticable strength of mine. Since I have experience and some knowledge on most of the topics we covered in the project, I was able to contribute to the programming side of things and help my teamates debug their code and get their ideas to operate.

#### Weaknesses:
Planning was one of my biggest weaknesses for the project. I think that if I was able to plan out the project and all of the features with more percision, our site would be easier to develop. This would also allow the other developers to work on the project and get an understanding of the situation/goal.
